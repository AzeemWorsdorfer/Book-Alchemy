📚 Book Alchemy LibraryBook Alchemy is a simple, secure, and user-friendly web application for managing a digital library collection. Built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, it allows users to track authors and the books they've published, including features for searching, sorting, and maintaining data integrity through cascading deletes.✨ FeaturesCreate Authors and Books: Add new records via dedicated forms (/add_author, /add_book).Search and Sort: Filter the main library view by title or ISBN, and sort the list by Book Title or Author Name.Secure Session Management: Uses a secret key loaded from environment variables to secure user sessions and flash messages.Data Integrity:Delete Book: Remove individual books. If a deleted book was the author's last work, the author is also automatically removed.Delete Author: Remove an author, which automatically deletes all associated books (cascading delete).🚀 Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to get the Book Alchemy application running locally on your machine.1. PrerequisitesYou will need Python 3.8+ installed.2. Clone the Repositorygit clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
cd Book-Alchemy
3. Create a Virtual EnvironmentIt is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# .\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows (CMD)

4. Install DependenciesInstall all required packages (Flask, SQLAlchemy, python-dotenv):pip install -r requirements.txt

(If you haven't created a requirements.txt, run: pip freeze > requirements.txt)5. Configure the Secret KeyFor security, the application loads its session secret key from an environment variable.Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project.Add a strong, random string for the SECRET_KEY:SECRET_KEY='your_long_and_very_secret_key_here_a1b2c3d4e5'

6. Initialize the DatabaseThe application uses a SQLite database (data/library.sqlite). You need to initialize the tables by uncommenting the setup code at the bottom of app.py and running the file once, or by running this command:python -c "from app import app, db; with app.app_context(): db.create_all(); print('Database tables created successfully.')"

7. Run the ApplicationStart the Flask development server:flask run

The application will typically be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.📌 UsageRouteMethodDescription/GETMain Library view.
